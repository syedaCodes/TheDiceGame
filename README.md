# TheDiceGame
A dice game for two players competing to reach the default target or a set target.
Each round score gets added to the total score. When a player rolls a one, the current round's score is set to 0 and the dice is passed to the next player. The player can choose to hold, get the total score updated with the score he/she has earned and pass the dice to the next player.
